Dynamic vector right now is implemented with a begin and end pointer. Adding a
capacity vector would allow:
    - Default initialization (we could remove the two constructors in static_array)
    - Dynamic size within some bounds, which is interesting if simulations would
      require growing or shrinking their size.
But would:
    - Just be a worse implementation of std::vector
